# Concepts

## The `.quilt` file format

A `.quilt` file is ordinary source code in some *ground language* plus Quilt bracket syntax layered on top. The ground language is inferred from the file's inner extension:

| Filename            | Ground language                               |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `foo.rs.quilt`      | Rust                                          |
| `foo.py.quilt`      | Python                                        |
| `foo.wgsl.rs.quilt` | Rust (ground), WGSL (default for bare quotes) |

When expanded, the `.quilt` suffix is stripped to produce the output file name.

## Operator glyphs

All Quilt operators are Unicode characters. The VS Code extension provides chord keybindings so they are easy to type (see [Editor Setup](editor-setup.md)).

| Glyph | Name          | Meaning                                           |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `↖`   | left-quote    | Open a quote bracket                              |
| `↗`   | right-quote   | Close a quote bracket                             |
| `↙`   | left-unquote  | Open an unquote bracket                           |
| `↘`   | right-unquote | Close an unquote bracket                          |
| `↑`   | lift          | Convert a runtime value into a `QTerm`            |
| `↓`   | reduce        | Evaluate a `QTerm` by compiling and running it    |
| `←`   | emit          | Append a term into the surrounding variadic block |
| `⟨T⟩` | type          | Placeholder for `Arc<QTerm>` in bootstrap source  |
| `⟨N⟩` | name          | Create an identifier node                         |
| `\↑`  | escape-lift   | Literal `↑` in source (not a Quilt operator)      |
| `\↓`  | escape-reduce | Literal `↓` in source (not a Quilt operator)      |

Quilt-level line comments are written `⟨//⟩ ...` and block comments `⟨/*⟩ ... ⟨*/⟩`. They are stripped during parsing and never appear in the output.

## Quote and unquote

### Quote `↖…↗`

A quote bracket wraps a code fragment and turns it into a *value* — a `QTerm` that can be inspected, transformed, and emitted later:

```rust
// In a .rs.quilt file:
let expr: Arc<QTerm> = ↖1 + 2↗;
```

This expands to Rust code that *constructs* the `1 + 2` AST at runtime using the `QTermBuilder` API:

```rust
let expr: Arc<QTerm> = tb("binary_expression")
    .c(&leaf("integer_literal", "1"))
    .w(" + ")
    .c(&leaf("integer_literal", "2"))
    .b();
```

An annotation before `↖` specifies the language of the quoted fragment:

```rust
let html_frag = html↖<p>Hello</p>↗;
let wgsl_frag = wgsl↖vec4<f32>(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)↗;
```

An un-annotated `↖…↗` defaults to the host language, or to the second language in the file's extension chain (e.g. `shaders.wgsl.rs.quilt` → bare quotes default to WGSL).

### Unquote `↙…↘`

An unquote bracket splices an already-built term *into* a quote:

```rust
let one = ↖1↗;
let expr = ↖↙one↘ + 2↗;  // splices `one` at the hole position
```

The inner content of an unquote is code in the *ground* language evaluated at code-generation time.

## Quasi-quoting and staging

Quilt is a *two-level* language. The ground level runs at code-generation time; the sky level (inside `↖…↗`) is data that will be serialized to the output file.

`Stage` in the engine tracks the current depth:
- `Stage::Ground` — executing code. Quotes capture their content and reduce become evaluations.
- `Stage::Sky(lang, depth)` — inside `depth` levels of nested quotes.

Nested quotes increment the depth; unquotes decrement it. An unquote whose depth would reach zero is *escaped* back to ground and its content is evaluated.

## Indentation and whitespace

Quilt automatically dedents the content of a quote block. Leading whitespace common to all lines inside `↖\n…\n↗` is stripped, so deeply-nested quoted code stays readable:

```rust
let block = ↖
    for i in 0..10 {
        println!("{i}");
    }
↗;
// The common four-space indent is stripped before parsing.
```

## Variadic nodes and emit `←`

Some language nodes accept an arbitrary number of children — `block` and `source_file` in Rust, for example. Inside a variadic quote, `←` (emit) appends a term to the growing list:

```rust
let program = ↖{
    ↙{
        for i in 0..n {
            ↖println!("{i}");↗.←;
        }
    }↘
}↗;
```

The unquote `↙{…}↘` runs a Rust loop at generation time; each iteration emits one `println!` statement into the outer block.

## Lift `↑` and reduce `↓`

`↑` (lift) converts a value into a `QTerm`. What "lift" means is language-specific:

- **Rust `↑`** — calls `qlift()` on the value, building a term whose code reconstructs it. Integers become `integer_literal` nodes; strings become `string_literal` nodes; `Arc<QTerm>` values lift themselves recursively.
- **Python `↑`** — similar, delegated to the `quilt` Python module.

`↓` (reduce) evaluates a `QTerm` by compiling it (via `rust-script` for Rust) and deserializing the result using `postcard`:

```rust
let n: i32 = ↓↖21 + 21↗;  // evaluates to 42 at generation time
```

## The `⟨T⟩` and `⟨N⟩` operators

These are used internally in bootstrap source:

- `⟨T⟩` expands to `Arc<QTerm>` — the canonical type of a quilt term in Rust meta-code.
- `⟨N⟩` creates an `identifier` node from a string — useful when building code that references a named variable.
